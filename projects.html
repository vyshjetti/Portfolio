              <h2>My Work Experience as an ISPP Scholar</h2>
              <p>
                As an ISPP Scholar, I had the opportunity to share my journey and experiences in a blog post for Illinois Extension. In this article, I reflected on my role, which included leveraging my skills as a data analyst to evaluate program effectiveness and identify trends in disaster preparedness. This experience allowed me to grow both personally and professionally while contributing to a meaningful cause.

              <h2>MyPI: Disaster Preparedness Initiative</h2>
              <p>
                I collaborated with Illinois Extension staff on the My Preparedness Initiative (MyPI), a program dedicated to training young people in Illinois about emergencies and disasters. My role involved promoting the program, conducting research, and supporting its mission to build a more resilient community. This project allowed me to combine my passion for education, research, and community service.
